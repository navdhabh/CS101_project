# CS101_project
Required features:

1. Modified the bubble movement to incorporate vertical motion such that the bubbles travel in a parabolic path.
2. Introduced collision between the bubble and the bullet; the bubble disappears after a bullet hits it. After a collision, the bullet disappears too.
3. Introduced collision between the bubble and the shooter; the shooter is dead if a bubble touches it.

Extra features:

1. Used bubbles of different sizes. When a bullet hits the larger bubbles, they split into smaller bubbles (half the radius of the original larger bubble) and move in horizontally opposite directions.
2. Implemented different levels of the game. Once all the bubbles in one level are destroyed, the game moves on to the next level which is difficult in terms of more bubbles and faster moving bubbles. The bubbles in different levels have different colors. There are a total of 3 levels.
